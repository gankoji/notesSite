A friend from the r/math discord suggested live tex via laptop in class over using a tablet for handwriting. Both approaches have their merits, although neither directly integrates with Evernote for organization. Ideally, I would use Evernote directly, and simply type prose for notes. That said, I'm still going to want to be able to write math easily while in lecture, so it isn't a totally viable approach. Tex has the advantage of getting everything typeset just right, but Nebo's math recognition from handwriting has the benefit of being slightly faster (only on math!). I'm gravitating toward the keyboard, since it's so much faster for me to enter text that way, but I worry about not being fast enough with tex. Maybe that's something I can fix? I think I should just try both of them, and see how it goes.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I did find a couple of ideas for a template for Cornell Notes in latex, and I'm going to give them a shot too.

Writing LaTeX directly is somewhat of a pain, but that pain can be alleviated to some extent via the macros and functions contained in AUCTeX. I'm also considering doing something along the lines of org export to LaTeX, that way I get all of org's nice features like capture and refile and tree organization. I don't have much experience with either, though, so I'll need something to practice on. I'll have to evaluate the pros and cons of writing in a LaTeX buffer directly vs the org buffer and export option. Org export does seem rather painless so far, so it might not be much of a toss up. Finally, there's the option to use LyX instead of emacs and writing buffers directly.

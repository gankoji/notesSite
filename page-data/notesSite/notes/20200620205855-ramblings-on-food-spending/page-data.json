Average grocery expenditure is $1,650, leaving something like $600 per month split between restaurants and fast food. Now, fast food, while objectionable on a health concern basis, is actually the one place I want to leave intact, since it makes Amber's life much easier some days and of course it makes the kids happy when they get to go to their favorite places for lunch and dinner. Restaurant eating is expensive, of course, but that's one of my favorite things to do, especially with Amber. Maybe we can reduce our overall expenditure by not going out to sit down restaurants unless its just the two of us, especially since we have the grandparents around now to babysit for date nights.\"), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Point 1: No more sit-down restaurant meals with the whole family, unless\\ntotally necessary.

We need to examine our weekly and monthly grocery expenditures in detail, and see if there are any opportunities for bulk purchase (or online purchase) that can reduce our overall monthly spend rate.

We do buy some of this stuff already at Costco, but if there's a strong usage pattern and price advantage to buying in bulk, we should consider it.\"), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Point 2: Examine monthly grocery spending, look for patterns and regular buys.\\nCompare local grocer pricing vs bulk (Costco) vs online pricing with shipping, and see if there are some items that we can switch up our purchasing on to get better deals overall.

I was doing this for a good stretch of time while living alone, and it had some pretty solid spending benefits. I'd like to start that up again, and maybe even consider getting the kids involved, since their lunches are a not-insignificant part of the food bill every month. Taking just groceries into account, $1,650 per month averages to $310 per person per month, or just about $10 per person per day. If we can shave off even $3 from that total, we can make a huge impact to the monthly total.

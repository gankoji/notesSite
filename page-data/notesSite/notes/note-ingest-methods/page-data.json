Then, you have the mobile interface, which is also super simple and takes all of a few hundred milliseconds to go from idea while out and about to notes in your system. Then there's the webapp too, for when you're at a keyboard but can't be bothered (or don't have the ability) to install the full fat client.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One huge annoyance with it, though, is the fact that their \\\"dark mode\\\" isn't really a dark mode at all!

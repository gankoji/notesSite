Why am I spending all this time writing about apps when I have trusty old org-mode here in the first place? Well, the perennial problems with org-mode are still here: there's little support for multimedia (you can link to multimedia files in local storage, but they have to be created elsewhere, and file links are notoriously brittle), and there's no good solution for noting from a mobile device.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Since this is still the case, I think the best bet going forward is to keep one of these apps around, for web capture, multimedia capture, and mobile noting. Even though the main ZK is going to be here in org-mode, I'm going to need another app to support spontaneous thought. Since Evernote doesn't support direct Markdown export, there's not much reason to stick with it. Joplin does, but its mobile app has issues. Thus, I think I'm stuck with OneNote for now. From time to time, I'll need to do the ON->Evernote->Joplin->Markdown trick to get things into permanent format, but that's a pain that shouldn't be necessary too often since I don't plan to rely on ON anymore for my primary datastore.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"},"inboundReferenceNotes":[{"title":"about-these-notes","slug":"about-these-notes","childMdx":{"excerpt":"About These Notes Hi, and welcome to my notebook!

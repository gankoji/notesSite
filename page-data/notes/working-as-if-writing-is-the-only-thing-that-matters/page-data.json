Research is effectively writing, because you should be writing while reading, and then you're formulating ideas when you're writing them down to compose an argument or to summarize an idea or an article.

Is it because the tenets of doing it well are a closely guarded secret, or more that they were discovered as a by product of a great scientist's career, that he never bothered to publish and we're just now having to figure them out posthumously? I lean toward the latter, but no doubt there are others out there in our history who have figured out a similar process, framework, and philosophy regarding writing, and similarly let it fall by the wayside while they focused on publishing in their preferred domain.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Frankly, I think the main reason that writing is treated as such a secondary concern in modern education is the fact that it's often seen as nothing more than a tool for communication or documentation, rather than the embodiment of the thinking process itself.

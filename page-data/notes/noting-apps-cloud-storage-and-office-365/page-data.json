I of course enjoy Outlook, especially since my search for alternatives has really come up fruitless. I don't have any real preference between Word or Excel and their LibreOffice alternatives. OneNote is ok, but I think it deserves a little bit more discussion.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The major attraction to the subscription is the whopping 1 TB of online cloud storage. This is absolutely massive compared to the 4 GB (Dropbox) and 15 GB (Google Drive), so it's attractive.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So the thing I've been considering is whether or not OneNote is a good substitute note taking platform. It has a lot going for it: it can accept all different types of media, it very simply handles auto syncing with OneDrive, and it's more or less organizable and navigable. It does have search capability as well. So, overall, I think this platform has the basic capabilities we need for good notes.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Another point in its favor is that nearly everyone at Microsoft uses this platform not just for personal note taking, but for formatting and sharing documents and notebooks. I find that kind of interesting, but to be fair it's organization capabilities do make it much more attractive than the linear organization format that normal documents and PDFs. I think I can get behind it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Really, though, I just need to consider whether the alternatives are worth the trouble, since OneNote is the incumbent here. Org-mode has its downfalls, mostly that org files suffer from the same linear organization as normal documents, and that the files aren't shareable in a very graphically pleasing way.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"},"inboundReferenceNotes":[],"outboundReferenceNotes":[]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Jake's Notes"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"noting-apps-cloud-storage-and-office-365"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}

It seems like the anxiety has just come racing back, full speed, and I can't point to a clear cause or catalyst. I'm sure it's at least partly to do with starting the new gig at Microsoft, but I'm not sure that's the entire story.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Looking back, the time when my anxiety was at its worst was last October. I was in the middle of basically failing and flailing my way through two graduate math classes, trying to hold it together, while simultaneously being dropped into the trash bin at work and left to do basically nothing for 6 months. I wonder if the play between major mental struggles with the stress of doing so poorly in those classes, and feeling completely and utterly useless at work (due to tasking) was a major factor in the breakdown.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I've come across this line of reasoning because I think that the same thing is happening to me this week. I'm in a new role with a new team at a new company, where I've basically been unable to do anything except watch HR training videos and keep myself entertained by trying to learn new software frameworks and technologies.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I feel stressed because I'm not being pushed, or stressed by the work. I think that this reminds me, uncomfortably, of the time when I was completely detached from work and basically started phoning it in 5 or 6 years ago at CEI, that ultimately led (indirectly or directly, still undecided on that) to the downfall of the company. I guess I have this knee jerk reaction now to falling into ruts like that.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I do need to work on my sleep. This week wasn't a great sleep week for me, so I'm sure that that has contributed to the overall anxiety level. Reviewing what Dr. Whitter and I discussed a while back, I think I should try to get back onto some sort of regular schedule for sleep, and focus on winding down at the end of the day to help me get into a good night's rest. Set a schedule: let's say that midnight works as a good sleep time. This puts me waking up around 8 in the morning, which works with my schedule as it currently stands. That means about 2230 I start getting ready, stretching, brushing my teeth, taking my vitamins and allergy meds. 2300 I head to bed, get settled in, watch a boring/relaxed show or two, and then cut the tv off and get meditating/listening to relaxing music and trying to fall asleep around 0000.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What about the time before that? Should I be doing something special before then? Sitting in a dark room will probably help, and reducing blue light exposure if I'm at the computer is a plus. Or sitting on the couch downstairs, hanging out with Amber and watching TV.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Another important note from previous research on all this is that I should do my best not to change my sleep schedule too drastically throughout the week. Try to wake up right around the same time everyday, and don't change that time more than an hour throughout the week. Even on the weekends!\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A final note is that I've already blocked out time on my calendar to do things like get up and take a walk and/or stretch out, so that I'm not sitting cramped up the whole day, and I've also got time for meditation and a little gaming during my lunch break. I have to do my best to get through this marathon that is a career, and remember that that's what it is, and not a sprint. A little exercise/yoga during the day will help out with the sleepiness at night, too, not to mention my physical fitness. Mix in some calisthenics and body weight exercises to turn up the heat and work off some stress. Sitting around in a chair and worrying all day isn't good for my long term health.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"},"inboundReferenceNotes":[],"outboundReferenceNotes":[]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Jake's Notes"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"20200620205420-anxiety-journal-20200607"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}

I have some rather grandiose plans, and they will probably take quite a while to get spun up, but that's ok by me.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I want to setup a NAS on the network to support a) local backup, b) media sharing, and c) other general network/serving tasks (maybe a print server?). I think that PLEX is a good software solution for serving media from a central server, but I don't know much about it. I also don't have a whole lot of media (electronically stored) atm. I'll need to think about remedying that. Maybe there's a convenient, if tedious in quantity, way to rip from DVD/Blu-Ray? More research needed!\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The Master Plan\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The plan is to take the old CEI server rack and install it in the downstairs closet. From there, I want it to serve PLEX and backup services to the network, in addition to shared network storage. Obviously, in order to do that, I'm going to need to get it a connection to the router, which is currently located in my office. This can be achieved either through running cable through the walls, or trying to get some bastardized WiFi system setup.

Ideally, I would be able to get a hardline drop into every room in the house, including the foyer and living room.

The office and the bedrooms upstairs are obvious need points, thought.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So that's the really big project. Running cable through walls is a huge hassle to begin with, not to mention the complete lack of mezzanine/crawl space in between floors of my house. That said, I can always look for common walls (the back and right side walls are obvious candidates for everything downstairs except the closet) and just run everything from the attic above the second floor. Then, I can also get drops into all the bedrooms and the office from up there too. This is absolutely a winter/spring project, not a summer project, so keep that in mind.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I figure one or two drops to each room is adequate, with the exception of the closet and maybe the office, due to placement of the coax cable drops for the modem.

I'll have to double check that.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One note here is that while I currently have available a 1 Gbps switch, with (I think) 16 or 24 ports, I don't plan to keep the network at 1 Gbps forever.

I get drop outs relatively frequently on my phone while passing Roku audio data from the TV to my bluetooth headphones. I'm thinking that a new setup for WiFi is necessary. It might be as simple as having a secondary (and/or tertiary) access point spread out throughout the house, in addition to no longer relying on my combo modem/router as the only AP.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So after all this networking, we should be setup really well for a high device-count home: 16 ish devices hardwired over 1 Gbps ethernet (eventually 10 Gbps), including the Roku and maybe the TV downstairs (or maybe another Roku if the TV can't handle ethernet), the server and NAS, my PC, and whatever the kids end up with.

Currently, we have a 2U, single Xeon server with a couple of hard disks attached, a 1U, 4 drive NAS (with busted old drives that I shouldn't trust to anything).

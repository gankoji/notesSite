Org-ref has the same sort of functionality (by drag and dropping a PDF into an org buffer, and/or querying various search engines), which is also limited here at work. That said, google scholar and others have the ability to export bibtex directly, so copy pasting into a bib buffer is almost as easy as using the browser plugin. I do have concerns as to managing the storage of the actual PDF files of my references, which Zotero and Qiqqa are supposed to make easier, but I haven't made a decision on that yet.

The first step was to cut out nearly all grains from my diet, and specifically to completely remove wheat. Various reasons for this, but most of them center around the fact that gluten and gliatins in wheat are rather dangerous when consumed in quantity, especially for folks who have sensitivity to grasses (wheat being a grass). The second step was to begin to care more thoroughly for my microbiome, mostly by consuming foods and drinks that are fermented with cultures of bacteria necessary for a healthy microbiome. These foods include yogurt, kefir (milk/yogurt kefir and 'water kefir', which actually contain different culture types), kombucha, and many pickled foods.  \"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Great Results!\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"While making these drastic changes to my diet hasn't been easy (especially for Amber, since her job cooking most days of the week has got a bit harder for no real fault of her own), it has been worth it.

The last week I've had awful stomach pain and diarrhea. It's been hard to suss out the exact cause, as I picked up a bit of a cold from Nigel's birthday outing (as we all did), and I originally wanted to attribute it to that. However, the stomach issues lasted nearly a week (culminating in me having to take yesterday completely off of work), where I was basically unable to do any sort of concentration work due to having to stop every 10-15 minutes to hit the restroom. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I did a little experimentation the last few days, by removing both the psyllium husk fiber supplement I've been taking every morning, as well as all probiotic foods, from my diet. I was finally able to sleep through the night the last two nights as a result, and have had significantly less pain and fewer trips to the restroom as well. Then, this morning, I decided to add back in my probiotics as a test (starting with a glass of kefir for breakfast), and just now the pain and constant gas has returned. I think we've reached a point of saturation in my gut that my body needs some time to adjust to. I'm going to go easy on both of the above mentioned facets for the next week or two, and see how my body adjusts. Hopefully, it does so quickly. If not, I may have to look at balancing/cycling my intake of probiotics to make sure I'm at a good level regularly. \"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"},"inboundReferenceNotes":[{"title":"health-index","slug":"health-index","childMdx":{"excerpt":"20200620180517-getting_help_with_anxiety \n 20200620180621-stress_and_relaxation_exercises \n 20200620180653-anxiety \n 20200620183907-key…"}},{"title":"more-notes-on-dietary-changes","slug":"more-notes-on-dietary-changes","childMdx":{"excerpt":"It Would Seem...

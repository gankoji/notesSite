Shortly after, had some pretty intense stomach pain and a very large bowel movement, but hard to say whether that was wheat directly or a combination of it and the dinner we had just beforehand (Birria tacos, again). Today, though, I've had an unshakeable case of hay fever, despite not missing my allergy meds for at least a week straight. I even rinsed out my sinuses and took flonase, although admittedly flonase takes a while to build up to have any real effect (multiple days). Just wanted to get this down in the notes so I can refer to it again in a few weeks when I come off of my wheat restriction, compare symptoms now and then. As a side note, I also used my kayfun 5 for the first time in a few weeks yesterday, and have been using it quite a bit. I don't expect that to have an effect, but you never know what's relevant until you rule it out. \"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"},"inboundReferenceNotes":[{"title":"health-index","slug":"health-index","childMdx":{"excerpt":"20200620180517-getting_help_with_anxiety \n 20200620180621-stress_and_relaxation_exercises \n 20200620180653-anxiety \n 20200620183907-keyâ€¦"}}],"outboundReferenceNotes":[]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Jake's Notes"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"effects-of-wheat"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}

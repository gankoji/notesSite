As a practicing engineer, my career in the aerospace and defense industries has spanned the better part of a decade. I currently serve as a Software Engineer for Microsoft, in the Azure Edge and Platform division. There, my area of specialization and primary work is in distributed computing: improving throughput, reliability, availability, and security of customer facing APIs and services. I have previously been employed in instructional roles as well, serving as an adjunct faculty member for the Department of Mechanical Engineering at California State University, Fullerton, for the 3 years prior to my move to Tucson.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Of particular importance to me is the areas of research available in a given program. This is why I believe the Graduate Interdisciplinary Program in Applied Mathematics is an excellent fit for my research interests. I have a strong desire to contribute to the growing body of mathematical and computational research in the world. My experience this far with your faculty has convinced me that this is the program with which I stand the best chance of so doing.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Although difficult to enumerate succinctly, I believe my educational objectives can be roughly summarized under three main categories. First and foremost, I aim to further the state of the art of mathematics and computation, through research and application of new principles to practical methods, algorithms, and approaches. Secondly, I endeavor to satisfy my own innate curiosity of the world, the universe, and their inner workings. Finally, perhaps my most weighty objective is to demonstrate to my family and children that even in the face of adversity, great heights can be reached with enough determination and perseverance.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It is, and always has been, my primary objective to further the state of the art of mathematics and computational science. I am firmly of the opinion that in the same way humanity has come to be a global civilization due in large part to our successes in communication and terrestrial and aeronautic transportation, our reach will come to extend beyond the extents of our solar system as we continue to improve our understanding, technology, and safety in space transportation. As we continue to develop our understanding of the complex fields of estimation, optimization, non-linear analysis, and other seemingly esoteric areas of mathematics, our understanding of the world we live in, and how best to harness its intricacies, continues to improve in proportion. I believe that by thorough study, and innovative use, of mathematical and computational techniques, I can contribute to this ever growing body of work in a positive, and even formative, manner.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A major motivating force in this endeavor stems from an almost insatiable curiosity of the inner workings of the world we occupy. Over the course of my academic and professional careers, my quest for knowledge has lead me down many seemingly disjoint paths: mathematics, natural sciences, computer programming, signal processing, computer vision, robotics, control systems, the list goes on. In each of these fields, I've spent weeks and months (sometimes years) devoting myself to studying their underlying principles and fundamentals. Nearly all of this study has been extracurricular in nature, falling outside of my then current academic programs. However, many times these \\\"excursions\\\" came full circle: ending with me having tried, failed, and eventually succeeded, at grasping material that would then become relevant to my later work. This was nearly always to the surprise of my colleagues, who were content to delay their study of difficult material until instructed to do so. This was no accident! Rather, it was a fortuitous navigation of the complexities of the realm of higher education. It is my belief that this type of drive and willingness to explore is exceedingly useful to a PhD candidate in a competitive research program.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"At first glance, it might seem odd that an individual would spend such an inordinate amount of effort in the pursuit of knowledge. My (now) wife and I had our first child at the ripe old age of 22, while I was still an undergrad. No more than two months after we had first learned of our coming child, we lost my father to lung cancer, and my brother to his life long battle with Cystic Fibrosis, all in the span of 6 days. Needless to say, this was neither an easy nor a short time in my young family's life.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"At this point, I had a choice to make. I could let gloom and misery drive my work and define me, or I could press on and make the best of it. I chose the latter, and did my best to work through what would be the most challenging years of my life: lead the family business through a rough patch after losing the CEO (my father), finish a bachelor's and master's degree in mechanical engineering, provide for my family, and raise my children, all while also teaching part-time, so we could afford to have my wife stay home with them.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In the end, the choice proved fruitful, and I was able to manage this workload with the unending support of my family and friends. Yet, I personally feel that I haven't quite finished. Admittedly, I could be content to have made it through those times, and have plenty of lessons to teach my children about perseverance and determination. Still, there is an unfulfilled desire within me to push myself beyond this equilibrium point, to take my education and my career to the next level, and to demonstrate to my children that through adversity, there's rarely a good substitute for drive, motivation, and sheer power of will.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"These factors, along with many others, are what have culminated in this application to your program. I hope that this has served to illuminate further my desire and motivation to pursue a degree within your ranks. I look forward to working with you in the near future.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Sincerely,\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Jake Bailey\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"},"inboundReferenceNotes":[],"outboundReferenceNotes":[]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Jake's Notes"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"am-statement-of-purpose-20200105"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}

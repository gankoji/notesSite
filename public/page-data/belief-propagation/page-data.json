Unfortunately, that wasn't much. There was a lot of talk about different combinatorial optimization problems, three in particular: Maximal Weight Matching, Minimum Weight Vertex Cover, and Maximum Weight Independent Sets. The problem was, I don't really understand why any of those problems are interesting or useful. They do mention, in the paper, that you can transform just about any sort of combinatorial/discrete optimization problem into one of those three. Hopefully, I'll discover how to do that in the near future. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One thing that I noticed, is that while they mention OpenMP and other parallelization technologies, they don't really use them. Their 'parallel' implentation is only using pthreads and task queues, which limits the ability of the implementation to scale beyond a single processor/memory bank. It also precludes heterogeneous computing. Maybe this is where I can come in? It would be really awesome to see something like this spread out across 1000 or so cpus, maybe even a couple dozen GPUs as well, something that can super scale.

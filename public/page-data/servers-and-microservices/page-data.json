The great thing about servers is that, in a tightly controlled environment, you can easily scale capacity to meet demand by adding more hardware. When you specialize servers to specific tasks, such as virtualization (compute), file sharing (storage), database serving, web service, email, print, etc, the 'scaling to demand' becomes even easier. This is the approach taken by most large corporate offices today (and of the last two to three decades). The concept of a microservice, while seemingly completely different, is actually no more than an incremental extension of this specialization. In fact, I bet it was invented by some guy going 'hey, if we can just throw another rack at our email service when the load doubles, why can't I do the same with my message queue in this forum site I'm hosting?' \"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"While I'm on the topic...\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"src\": \"/pasted-image-20201026231409png\",\n    \"alt\": \"Pasted image 20201026231409.png\"\n  })), \"\\nGiven the level of scalability and flexibility the microservice fad has brought to the tech world, are there other places currently served by traditional software designs and methodologies that could be supplanted by these techniques? I definitely think the capacity exists in most storage heavy paradigms, such as databases, personal data management, etc. It would be really interesting, even just as an exercise, to work up the whole 'personal datavault' project with a microservices architecture, rather than a monolith. Just thinking about the productivity gains from being able to refactor independently makes me a little giddy. \"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"},"inboundReferenceNotes":[],"outboundReferenceNotes":[{"title":"pasted-image-20201026231441png","slug":"pasted-image-20201026231441png","childMdx":{"excerpt":""}},{"title":"pasted-image-20201026231409png","slug":"pasted-image-20201026231409png","childMdx":{"excerpt":""}}]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Jake's Notes"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"servers-and-microservices"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}

In particular, it dealt with making it more like the 'conversation partner' that Luhmann hyped it up to be. Probably the key point made in there is that more links means more and better search results when coming back to \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"%5Cthe-zettelkasten-system\"\n  }), \"The Zettelkasten System\"), \" for a conversation. The basic method for creating better links in your notes is simple: \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"1) Notes need to be more atomic. My notes aren't atomic enough at the moment, and I recognize that.\\n2) Add three links to every note:\\n1) A link to a more general note on the topic\\n2) A link to a more specific note on the same topic\\n3) A link to a tangentially related topic\\n3) Even if you don't have anything to add in those specific notes you link to, create them anyway and mark them as 'TK' (or similar). This way, when you come back to your zettelkasten and don't have anything to write about, simply search for 'TK' and boom, you've got topics that you meant to write about previously.

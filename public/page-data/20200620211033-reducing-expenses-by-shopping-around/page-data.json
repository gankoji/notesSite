I was pretty upset with USAA after my latest set of hassles with them (the Javelina incident in May 19), and noticed that they were outright expensive for shitty service. Full coverage for just the van was a $280 premium over 6 months. Adding the truck to that would bring the total to $610. That's for state minimum liability, no uninsured/under insured motorist coverage, no roadside, no rental, and $1k deductible.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Shopped around a few places, lowest rates came in from progressive. For a policy with 25k/50k/25k liability, 15k/30k uninsured and under insured, $500 deductible, medical bill coverage, roadside, rental, and Gap on the truck, the 6 month premium is $363. I feel a lot better about my life now that I have more peace of mind AND more money at the end of the day.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Decided to shop homeowners as well, found I can reduce my annual premium from $864 to $501 (around $30/mo). Haven't decided to take the plunge there yet, but that's a no-brainer since the coverage is almost identical.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So that's $80 ish I saved from the previous auto projections, and another $30 from homeowners. Still looking for other ways around to scrape together some extra relief on this budget. Other recent improvements include the $30 ish I've reduced my own mobile phone bill by switching to Ting (but that was offset by the new $57/mo charge for the new phone). What other spots are out there to find? There's also a roughly $50-$75 per month gain in cash back from the credit card. I could shop that around and see if we can boost it at all, but I'm skeptical that will prove fruitful.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"As always, the biggest expense every year proves to be in the category of Food and Dining. We've averaged $2,250/month in that category, with $1,650 of that being spent at grocery stores. Obviously, this is a huge chunk of change, and the best place to look to make cuts. I always hesitate to do so, though, since food is such a big part of our life and where we draw a lot of happiness and comfort from. I'll have to talk it over with Amber, but maybe there's some creative ways that we can reduce our food spending without hurting our overall comfort too much. Things like buying in bulk, and cooking in bulk some days for leftovers/meal prep. Maybe I can get back on the meal prep wagon and reduce my own personal food spending significantly. We'll have to see.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"},"inboundReferenceNotes":[{"title":"topics-in-finance","slug":"topics-in-finance","childMdx":{"excerpt":"Really, just an Index Note 20200620183826-financial_planning_software \n 20200620205855-ramblings_on_food_spending \n 20200620211033-reducingâ€¦"}}],"outboundReferenceNotes":[]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Jake's Notes"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"20200620211033-reducing-expenses-by-shopping-around"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}

The major problems we see now in how the scientific conversation plays out is that while science has become democratized, it has done so at the expense of support. Gone are the days when the primary drivers of science were the wealthy elite, doing the work themselves: nowadays, we set a wolf on the peasantry's heels (called living expenses), hold a carrot in front of their noses (called research grants and funding), and motivate the work that way. The troublesome problem of that is, that he who holds the carrot gets to point the direction in which the poor scientist is forced to run. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The big question is, how do you fix that without being a billionaire benefactor with nearly inexhaustable resources, whose motivations would then be questioned anyway?

I had the idea earlier tonight for a good starter app to whet my chops a bit when it comes to javascript development. I'm a bit disappointed with the available apps out there for note taking. Although they've improved significantly over the last few years, especially in the Zettelkasten space (Zettlr, Obsidian) and there's lots of wiki based solutions (vim wiki, markdown editors, vs code and atom plugins, etc), there's also been a real game changer in Roam Research.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Roam is important for a lot of reasons.

It's a webapp, which means no installation and no fuss, just run it straight from your browser. \", \"[This comes with downsides, as well, which I'll get to]\", \". Perhaps most importantly, though, is the fact that it implements, in an incredibly simple fashion, one of the most important pieces of Ted Nelson's Xanadu concept for the web: bidirectional links and graph connections.

It's still a mostly mouse and arrow key driven experience, which is hard to sell to an old emacs/spacemacs diehard like me. I'm just too committed to keeping my hands on the keyboard at this point in my life. Second, and probably more importantly, is the fact that all of the notes you place on Roam are trivially accessible by anyone, from anywhere, at anytime. There is no concept of privacy in this app. This is problematic for many reasons, but probably the most practical one at the moment for me is that I can't use it for work notes.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, I've decided to toss my hat in the ring and try to drum up a note taking app of my own.

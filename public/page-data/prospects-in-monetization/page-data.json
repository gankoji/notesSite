So, the question becomes one of 'how do we reduce the complexity of getting customers exactly what they need?' This isn't really a question that the big guys can answer effectively. They need to focus on supporting the 90% of customers who just want the plain jane stuff, and who complain the loudest when their stuff doesn't work. But can I, a self-proclaimed cloud expert, get in here in the middle and smooth out some of the complexity to open up a whole new niche world in the cloud? Building an application layer on top of IaaS to bring SaaS solutions to the mobile domain? The best part of all this is the granular billing level you get from any of the major cloud providers, making it trivial to bill your customers at a fixed markup rate from your own cost (if you choose to do it that way). \"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"},"inboundReferenceNotes":[{"title":"jakenotes-design","slug":"jakenotes-design","childMdx":{"excerpt":"The Endgame, First To call this project done, here are the things I would  tentatively  like to have.

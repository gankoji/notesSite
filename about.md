Hi, and welcome to my notebook! As you may have already guessed, this site is a style-clone of [Andy Matuschak's awesome notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). I have been using linked markdown style notes for quite some time now (first via org-mode, but now I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)), but thought it would be great to get my notes out into the public space. This is my attempt at 'working in public', where I share a view into my brain, and encourage discussion and networking on the topics which I'm currently most strongly considering. 

The navigation here isn't yet complete, so in the meantime, why not check out some of my current projects or topics?
